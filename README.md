# larlite

A lightweight interface to larsoft products. Originally developed from MicroBooNE analyses.

This version is a stripped-down, reorganization of the original `larlight/larlite` fork.

It uses CMake and removes the `UserDev` folder. Header files should now be referenced with a `larlite` prefix.
